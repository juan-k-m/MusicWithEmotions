    lgebra, probability, among others, which for me are of great interest. And that through techniques of analysis of large amounts of 
    data we can find relationships that allow us to see these large amounts of data from different perspectives and thus help us to obtain new information.

I am very interested in the topic of artificial intelligence, its areas of study and application. I intend to learn more about some of 
these areas such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

I am interested in working on a project to apply this knowledge, so I will find a job after this course."""
